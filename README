# Network Analysis of The Witcher Series

This Python project performs network analysis on characters from "The Witcher" series. It uses NLP to extract character relationships from the books and visualizes these relationships as network graphs.

## Features

- Extracts named entities (characters) from text using SpaCy.
- Filters entities to focus on main characters.
- Analyzes relationships based on textual proximity within a window of sentences.
- Visualizes character relationships using NetworkX and PyVis for both static and interactive graphs.

## Prerequisites

- SpaCy
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- NetworkX
- PyVis
